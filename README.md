Repo of my solutions to Rosalind problems.

The ```Julia_stronghold``` folder contains julia solutions to the bioinformatics stronghold problems devised from scratch, while the ```R_armory``` folder contain R solutions to the bioinformatics armory problems devised with the help of packages. 

the inputs and output folders are a collection of input and output txt files for some problems but not all.
