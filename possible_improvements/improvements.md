splc
- running all comparisons in 1 run. O(mn)
- accounting for overlap
- use of suffix tree
- burrows-wheeler transform

cons
- sequence consensus is technically an unsolved problem. (https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-8-S7-S21) 
  the implemented algorithm is the most basic brute force algorithm that has exponential time complexity though with 100% accuracy.
